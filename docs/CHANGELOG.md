# Changelog

All notable changes to OSPChat are recorded here. The format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Resolve `com.ospchat:ospchat-shared:0.1.0` from the GitHub Packages Maven
  registry instead of mavenLocal — matches the `ospchat-android` consumer
  setup. Set `gprUser` / `gprToken` (PAT with `read:packages`) in
  `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, or export `GITHUB_ACTOR` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- `make shared-publish` and the `release` / `all` target dependencies on it
  removed; CI workflows no longer checkout `ospchat-shared` as a sibling
  and instead authenticate to GitHub Packages with the runner-provided
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
